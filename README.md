# Map-Application

The College Resource Finder is a web application that helps users locate and explore universities along with nearby restaurants. Users can input a university name, and the application uses the Google Maps API to pinpoint the university's location on the map. It also identifies nearby restaurants, displaying them with blue markers on the map. Clicking on a marker reveals details about the restaurant, including its name and distance from the selected university. This project is designed to assist users in discovering both educational institutions and dining options in the vicinity.
